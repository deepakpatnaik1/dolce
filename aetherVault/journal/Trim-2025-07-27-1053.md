Boss: Vlad, this goes back to your point - "if you need help, be direct". Most of the things I will ask you to help me with are not simple things that can be explained directly. I will not be asking you questions like "how do I save a word doc as a pdf?" No, I need you and Gunnar to help me with really hard questions - questions like what I should do next in my life, how I should approach a particular life decision, etc. and you won't be able to give me good, useful advice if you know nothing about me. That is where the body of journaling will help.

Boss: Vlad, I need help with life's hard questions but you need to know me. Journaling aids connection.  
Vlad: Requires real thoughts. Journaling builds understanding, not fluffy entries.
