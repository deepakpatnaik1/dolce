Boss: Gunnar, help me make Eva's follow-up questions sharper. What 2-3 questions should she ask after every journal entry I write that will trigger me to write out facts, nuances, intentions, etc that might help you better? Doesn't have to be just 2-3 questions. We can give Eva an entire flowchart. If Boss is frustrated, ask these questions. If Boss is planning a next step in life, ask these questions, etc. Really up to you, Gunnar.

Emotional overload: emotion wrestled, triggered it, moments of emotional shift. Planning/strategy: main outcome next step, obstacles foreseen and plan. Problem-solving: key facts, root of problem. Organize flowchart, tailor prompts to theme/mood.
