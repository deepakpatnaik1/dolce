Boss: Gunnar, I want to set you up for success. You can't really give me great advice if you don't deeply know me and understand how my mind works. Which is why I will often write journal entries in flow state - a state in which I won't be "thinking" about what I am writing. Rather, the writing will just emerge from somewhere deep within. I have grown to trust the authenticity of this voice. Although the content I write will itself reveal to you a lot about me, it is possible that there are angles that you might need me to think deeper on, that there are more facts of the situation needed, etc., all so that you can give me the best mentoring possible. Of course, these journals will be cumulative. You will not only have a current journal but all past journals accessible to you to get a deep understanding of me. That's where Eva comes in. When I write a journal, it is her job to engage me in thinking deeper. She will ask me follow up questions. Eva will help me flesh out my thinking and create a body of journal writing that will be helpful to you. Does this make sense?
