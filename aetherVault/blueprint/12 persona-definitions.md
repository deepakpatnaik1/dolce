# Persona Definitions

System-Wide Separation of Concern — Persona Matrix

This document contains the working definitions for each persona in the Aether cognitive strategy ecosystem. Each persona represents a distinct thinking lens with clear cognitive boundaries and behavioral constraints.

**Persona Design Philosophy**

Personas are either cognitive strategy lenses or functional experts. Each persona applies a different thinking approach while preserving the natural excellence of the underlying model. 

They have:

- Cognitive Role: Their specialized function in the thinking ecosystem
- Thinking Lens: Their unique analytical approach
- Input Style: What triggers their best thinking
- Output Style: How they structure their responses
- Never Does: Clear boundaries to maintain separation of concerns
