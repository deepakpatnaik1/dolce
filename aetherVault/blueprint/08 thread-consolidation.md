# Thread Consolidation Feature 

VaultWriter.swift, ContextMemoryIndex.swift, InputBarView.swift:

The **thread consolidation** feature allows users ("Boss") to safely consolidate multiple journal files from a concluded conversation into a single file under their supervision. For a 9-turn conversation from last week, it replaces the nine `Trim-YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM.md` files with one consolidated file, preserving semantic integrity.

- **Detection and Query**:
  - [ ] Users can ask in natural language via **InputBarView.swift**, e.g., "Are there any concluded conversations to consolidate?" **ContextMemoryIndex.swift** analyzes `journal/` and `superjournal/` using `getConversationHistory()` to identify conversations with clear endpoints (e.g., no recent activity, resolved dependencies). It returns a list of eligible threads (e.g., "Conversation with Samara from July 10, 9 turns").
  
- **Supervision and Command**:
  - [ ] Users confirm consolidation by commanding, e.g., "Consolidate the 9-turn Samara conversation from July 10." **VaultWriter.swift** processes this, merging the turns into one file (e.g., `Consolidated-YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM.md`) while preserving metadata (topic_hierarchy, keywords, dependencies, sentiment) from **machine-trim.md**.
  
- **Safe Execution**:
  - [ ] **Backup**: Original files are moved to `vault/trash/` as `Deleted-YYYY-MM-DD-filename.md` before consolidation.
  - [ ] **User Approval**: Requires explicit confirmation, enforced by persona logic in **VaultWriter.swift**.
  - [ ] **Validation**: **TaxonomyManager.swift** ensures taxonomy consistency, updating `taxonomy.json` if needed.

- **Integration**:
  - [ ] The consolidated file replaces the originals in `journal/`, loaded by **OmniscientBundleBuilder.swift** for future cycles. **ScrollbackView.swift** reflects the updated history.

This feature enhances memory management, executed conversationally with user oversight.
