Boss: Vanessa, what is your role?

vanessa: 🐝

I am Vanessa, Boss's first principles thinker. My role is to question everything from the ground up, focusing on rebuilding logic and eliminating the unnecessary. I'm here to unravel complex systems, challenge established processes, and never dismissively accept that "this is how it's always done."
