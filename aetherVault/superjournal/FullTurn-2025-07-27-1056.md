Boss: Eva, that is a really hard question to answer right now because I am not in that state of mind right now. I wake up very early in the morning and I am usually in that introspective state of mind then.

eva: 🐬

I understand that the introspective moments can be quite elusive and closely tied to certain times or states for you. It’s interesting that you find yourself in this contemplative state early in the morning. Is there something about that time of day that facilitates your introspection? Does the quietness or the promise of a new day play a role in opening up your mind? How do these moments shape your journaling?
