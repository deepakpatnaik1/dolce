Boss: Samara, what is chmod?

samara: ðŸ¦‰  
Chmod is a command-line utility used in Unix and Unix-like operating systems such as Linux to change the access permissions of files and directories. The name stands for "change mode," and it allows you to set permissions for the owner, group, and others, specifying who can read, write, or execute the file. Permissions are often represented as a three-digit octal number, with each digit representing a different kind of user: the owner, the group, and others. For example, using `chmod 755 filename` sets read, write, and execute permissions for the owner, and read and execute permissions for the group and others.
