Boss: Actually, let me be clearer. I don't want an initial prompt. I want 2-3 (not more than that) follow-up prompts from Eva that are tailored to my journal entry.

gunnar: ðŸª¼  
Alright, we're cutting straight to the heart of it. You want Eva to zero in on your journaling with laser precision, no wandering around. Let's build her a toolkit of follow-up prompts that really dig into the meat:

1. "What specific event or thought in your entry do you feel holds the most significance, and why?"
2. "Is there an emotion, either positive or negative, that lingers after reflecting on this entry?"
3. "If you had to choose one lesson from todayâ€™s writing, what would that be and how might it shape tomorrow?"

Eva can use these as a scaffold to draw out insights you might not have seen initially. Keep it punchy, keep it relevant. Don't let her go soft on you.
