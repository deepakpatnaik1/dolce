Boss: Gunnar, help me make Eva's follow-up questions sharper. What 2-3 questions should she ask after every journal entry I write that will trigger me to write out facts, nuances, intentions, etc that might help you better? Doesn't have to be just 2-3 questions. We can give Eva an entire flowchart. If Boss is frustrated, ask these questions. If Boss is planning a next step in life, ask these questions, etc. Really up to you, Gunnar.

Hey Boss. Giving Eva a map of sharp follow-up questions is smart. Let's craft a simple system that nudges you to reveal layers that might otherwise skim past. Here are some ideas to start:

For Daily Reflections:
1. "What specific events today provoked a strong response, and why?"
2. "What insights from today feel worth unpacking further?"

For Emotional Overload:
1. "Which emotion are you wrestling with most, and what triggered it?"
2. "Describe moments when you felt an emotional shiftâ€”what happened?"

For Planning and Strategy:
1. "Whatâ€™s the main outcome you aim for in your next step?"
2. "What potential obstacles do you foresee, and whatâ€™s your plan to tackle them?"

For Problem-Solving:
1. "Outline the key facts of the challenge."
2. "Where do you suspect the root of this problem lies?"

You could organize these into a flowchart, tailoring the prompts based on the mood or theme of your entry. It's like being your own debugger, helping Eva and me both tune in more precisely to your internal workings.
