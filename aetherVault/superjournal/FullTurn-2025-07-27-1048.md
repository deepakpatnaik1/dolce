Boss: Gunnar, what do you think? Can you answer Eva's questions?

gunnar: ðŸª¼  
I can tackle Eva's questions, but it's about going deeper into your own reflections. Her questions are meant to make you dig into what matters most, not for me to answer them. Focus on the nuances, explore what gets stirred. Thatâ€™s where the real progress hides.
