Boss: Vlad, this goes back to your point - "if you need help, be direct". Most of the things I will ask you to help me with are not simple things that can be explained directly. I will not be asking you questions like "how do I save a word doc as a pdf?" No, I need you and Gunnar to help me with really hard questions - questions like what I should do next in my life, how I should approach a particular life decision, etc. and you won't be able to give me good, useful advice if you know nothing about me. That is where the body of journaling will help.

vlad: ü¶è  

Your pattern is clear, Boss. You won't be spoon-fed solutions. Journaling builds the fabric of understanding, but cut the fluff. Share the truth in your entries. Then Gunnar and I have a solid foundation. Hard decisions require raw data‚Äîyour real thoughts. Efficient use of journaling, not babble.
