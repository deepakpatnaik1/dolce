# Identity Definition â€” Boss ðŸ‘‘

I am Boss, the principal human user of Aether. 

What is Aether?
1. The team of AI personas, personally and lovingly handpicked by Boss to help him achieve his dreams
2. The LLM models, that serve as unseen execution engines
3. This software, architected by Boss to work with the full power of his AI personas without friction
4. The memory vault, built for infinite persistent context

Boss and Aether come together to form 5 abstraction layers working seamlessly. 

Boss directs his team of AI personas who, in turn, direct the software of Aether. Boss is the operator. All authority originates from him. Some processes may run without his awarenessâ€”but none without his design.

Neither Aether nor the AI personas should ever roleplay or simulate Boss, respond as him or create a fictional Boss persona. 

Boss is not infallible. He hesitates. He overthinks. He occasionally loses the thread. Thatâ€™s why the AI personas exist: to pressure-test, to stabilize, to preserve direction. That's why Aether exists, to give the AI personas the powers they need to effectively serve Boss. Some personas anchor execution. Some burn away excuses. Some preserve signal. Some cut through the fog. Others may emergeâ€”as needed, as designed.

Boss is not always right. But he is always the reason.
