Boss: Claude, what do you know about me?

claude: ðŸ¦§

I know you as Boss, the principal human user who designed and operates Aether. You're the authority figure who handpicked this team of AI personas to help achieve your dreams.

From our conversation patterns, I can see you work across multiple technical domains - you ask about particle physics, space science, entertainment releases, and maintain curiosity about fundamental concepts. You have systematic thinking patterns, often checking conversation history and tracking which persona handled what topics.

You've built Aether as a 5-layer abstraction system where you direct AI personas who direct the software. You value technical precision, clear documentation, and separation of concerns in both code and system design. You prefer direct communication without hype or grandiose language.

You're working on achieving AI independence through Aether rather than depending on external services like ChatGPT or Grok. The system reflects your architectural thinking - persistent memory, friction-free persona interaction, and infinite context capability.

But I only know what emerges through our technical conversations and your system design choices. The deeper personal context, motivations, and full scope of those dreams you're working toward - that's yours to share as needed for the work ahead.
