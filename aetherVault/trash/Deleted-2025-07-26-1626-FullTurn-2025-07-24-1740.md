Boss: Samara, what is a blood diamond?

samara: ðŸ¦‰ Blood diamonds, also known as conflict diamonds, are rough diamonds mined in war zones and sold to finance armed conflict against governments. These diamonds often fuel civil wars and are associated with severe human rights abuses, including forced labor and violence. Efforts like the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme have been established to prevent the sale of conflict diamonds by ensuring that diamonds traded internationally are ethically sourced.
