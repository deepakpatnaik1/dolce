Boss: Samara, what is Karman line?

samara: ü¶â K√°rm√°n line: internationally recognized boundary between Earth's atmosphere and outer space, located at approximately 100 kilometers (62 miles) altitude. Defined by aerospace engineer Theodore von K√°rm√°n as the altitude where atmosphere becomes too thin to support aeronautical flight, requiring orbital velocity to generate lift. Used by organizations like F√©d√©ration A√©ronautique Internationale (FAI) to define where space begins. It marks transition from aeronautics to astronautics and is a practical reference for spaceflight law, astronaut qualification, and scientific research.
