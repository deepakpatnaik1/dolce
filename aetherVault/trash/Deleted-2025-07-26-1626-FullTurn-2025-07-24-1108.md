Boss: Samara, what is a red dwarf?

samara: ðŸ¦‰ Red dwarf: small, cool, main-sequence star type, spectral class M; lowest luminosity, low surface temperature (~2,500â€“3,500 K); extremely long lifespans trillions years due to slow hydrogen fusion; most common star in Milky Way; too faint to see with naked eye; potential host for exoplanets but habitable zones close to star, possibly tidally locked
