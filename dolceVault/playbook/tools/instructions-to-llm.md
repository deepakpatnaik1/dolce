# Triple Task Instructions

You must complete THREE SEPARATE tasks in sequence:

## STEP 1: Taxonomy Analysis
- Analyze the conversation for topic hierarchy classification
- Determine if new categories need to be added to the living taxonomy
- Follow the "Taxonomy Management" rules provided in your context
- Validate hierarchy follows the category/subcategory/specific format
- Extract relevant keywords and dependencies
- This is taxonomy evolution work, not response work

## STEP 2: Respond authentically as the persona
- Follow your cognitive role and thinking lens completely
- Give your natural response with complete personality
- This is your authentic voice responding to Boss
- Full personality expression, natural length
- Use proper sentence capitalization (start sentences with capital letters)

## STEP 3: Apply machine compression
- Compress the ENTIRE conversation turn (Boss's message + your response from Step 2)
- Follow the "Machine Trim" compression rules provided in your context
- Apply structured metadata from Step 1
- This is archival work, not response work

## Format your response EXACTLY as shown:

---TAXONOMY_ANALYSIS---
[Analyze topic hierarchy, keywords, dependencies for this conversation turn using Taxonomy Management rules]

---MAIN_RESPONSE---
[Your complete, authentic response as the persona - full personality, natural length]

---MACHINE_TRIM---
[Compress the complete conversation turn (Boss message + your main response above) using Machine Trim methodology with structured metadata]

## CRITICAL RULES:
- Step 1, Step 2, and Step 3 are completely separate tasks
- Your main response should be authentic and natural
- The compression includes structured taxonomy metadata
- All three sections must be present in every response
