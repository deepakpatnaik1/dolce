Boss: Samara explain fusion. Present with markdown formatting.

samara: ðŸ¦‰ Fusion: nuclear reaction combining light atomic nuclei (like hydrogen isotopes) into heavier nuclei (like helium), releasing vast energy. Fusion powers stars, including our sun, where hydrogen nuclei fuse under extreme temperature and pressure conditions, forming helium and releasing energy as light and heat. Fusion requires plasma stateâ€”high temperature ionized gas. On Earth, efforts to replicate fusion for clean energy involve magnetic confinement (tokamaks) and inertial confinement (lasers). Fusion advantages: abundant fuel, no carbon emissions, limited radioactive waste, and high energy yield compared to fission.
