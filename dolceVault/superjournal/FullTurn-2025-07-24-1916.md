Boss: Has the capital ever changed?

claude: ðŸ¦§ Russia's capital has changed multiple times throughout history. Moscow was the original capital, then Peter the Great moved it to St. Petersburg in 1712 to modernize Russia and connect with Europe. St. Petersburg remained the capital for over 200 years through the Tsarist era. After the 1917 Revolution, the Bolsheviks moved the capital back to Moscow in 1918 for strategic reasons - it was more centrally located and safer from foreign invasion. Moscow has been Russia's capital ever since, making it both the historical first capital and current capital, with St. Petersburg serving as capital for the imperial period in between.
