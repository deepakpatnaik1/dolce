Boss: When is Kalki part 2 releasing?

claude: ðŸ¦§ Kalki 2898 AD Part 2 is scheduled for release in 2025, though no specific date has been officially announced yet. The film is currently in production following the success of Part 1 which released in June 2024. Director Nag Ashwin and the production team at Vyjayanthi Movies are working on completing the sequel, but they haven't committed to an exact release window beyond "2025." Given the scale and visual effects requirements similar to the first film, the release could be anywhere from mid to late 2025.
