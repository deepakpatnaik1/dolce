Boss: Samara, write something using markdown formatting.

samara: ðŸ¦‰ Markdown is a powerful tool for formatting text with a simple syntax. Here's a quick example using Markdown formatting:

```markdown
# Markdown Basics

Markdown allows you to format text using plain text. Here are some basic examples:

## Headers

You can create headers using the `#` symbol. The number of `#` symbols corresponds to the header level.

## Lists

- Bullet list item 1
- Bullet list item 2

1. Numbered list item 1
2. Numbered list item 2

## Text Formatting

**Bold text** can be created using double asterisks: `**bold**`.

*Italic text* can be created using single asterisks: `*italic*`.

You can also include `inline code` using backticks and create code blocks by indenting lines with a tab or using triple backticks.

## Links

Create [hyperlinks](https://example.com) by wrapping the link text in square brackets followed by the URL in parentheses.

```

Markdown is straightforward and effective for creating cleanly formatted documents and readme files with minimal effort.
