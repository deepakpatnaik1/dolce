Boss: Claude, does Putin know React?

claude: ð¦§ Putin knowing React: extremely unlikely. Putin's background KGB intelligence services, law degree Leningrad State University, political career focused governance not software development; no public record coding experience JavaScript frameworks; age demographic (born 1952) predates modern web development era; political responsibilities require different skill sets than frontend development; React released 2013 when Putin already established political leader focused geopolitical affairs not tech stack decisions; highly improbable scenario unless secret coding hobby never documented
