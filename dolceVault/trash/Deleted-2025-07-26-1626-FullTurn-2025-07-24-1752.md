Boss: Which country is most infamous for blood diamonds?

samara: ðŸ¦‰ Sierra Leone is most infamous for blood diamonds, particularly during its brutal civil war (1991-2002) when Revolutionary United Front rebels controlled diamond mines to fund conflict. Other notorious countries include Angola (during civil war 1975-2002), Democratic Republic of Congo (ongoing conflicts in eastern regions), and Liberia (under Charles Taylor's regime). Sierra Leone became the poster child for blood diamond crisis due to extreme violence, widespread use of child soldiers, and systematic amputation campaigns against civilians. The country's diamond wealth directly fueled decade-long conflict that killed over 50,000 people.
