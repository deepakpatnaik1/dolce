Boss: Claude what is CERN collider?

claude: ðŸ¦§ CERN collider: Large Hadron Collider (LHC), world's largest particle accelerator, 27-kilometer underground ring beneath France-Switzerland border. Accelerates protons/heavy ions to near light speed, collides them at four interaction points to study fundamental particles and forces. Key discoveries include Higgs boson (2012). Contains superconducting magnets cooled to -271Â°C, operates at energies up to 13.6 TeV. Multiple experiments run simultaneously: ATLAS, CMS, ALICE, LHCb. Built by European Organization for Nuclear Research, represents massive international collaboration advancing particle physics understanding.
