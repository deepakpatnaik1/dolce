Boss: Explain it in a markdown block.

samara: ðŸ¦‰ Certainly! Here's an explanation of markdown formatting within a markdown block:

```markdown
# Markdown Basics

- **Headers:** Start a line with 1-6 hash symbols (#) for different header levels.
- **Lists:** Use dashes (-) or asterisks (*) for bullet points, and numbers for ordered lists.
- **Text Formatting:**
  - *Italic* text with single asterisks or underscores.
  - **Bold** text with double asterisks or underscores.
  - ***Bold and italic*** with triple asterisks.
- **Links:** Format as `[label](URL)`.
- **Images:** Use `![alt text](image_url)`.
- **Code:** Inline code with backticks: `code`.
- **Code Blocks:** Surround with triple backticks:

  ```python
  def example():
      return "Code block in Python"
  ```

Markdown allows for clean, easy-to-read documentation while supporting rich text formatting.
