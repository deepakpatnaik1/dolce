- **Executive Powers**: Enforce federal laws, appoint heads of federal agencies, and issue executive orders.
- **Legislative Powers**: Sign or veto legislation, deliver the State of the Union address, and work with Congress to pass laws.
- **Diplomatic Powers**: Negotiate and sign treaties (which require Senate approval), appoint ambassadors, and represent the U.S. in international affairs.
- **Military Powers**: Serve as the commander-in-chief of the armed forces, deciding military strategies and overseeing national defense.
- **Judicial Powers**: Appoint federal judges, including Supreme Court justices, and grant pardons and reprieves.
